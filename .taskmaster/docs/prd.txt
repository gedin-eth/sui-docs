# Overview
The goal of this project is to create a comprehensive developer documentation repository (`sui-docs`) for the Sui ecosystem. This involves researching multiple repositories, verifying their functionality with scripts (CLI/curl), and documenting the findings.

# Core Features
- **Repository Research**: Deep dive into 18+ Sui-related repositories to understand their core functionality and usage.
- **Verification Scripts**: Create CLI or curl-based scripts to verify the functionality of each repository/protocol.
- **Documentation**: Update and expand the `sui-docs` repository with detailed guides, code examples, and verification steps.

# User Experience
The primary users are Sui developers who need clear, verified documentation for various protocols and tools in the ecosystem.

# Technical Architecture
- **Documentation Engine**: Markdown-based documentation in the `sui-docs` repository.
- **Verification Tools**: Bash scripts, `sui` CLI, `curl`, and protocol-specific SDKs.
- **Research MCP**: Use Context7 MCP to retrieve up-to-date documentation and examples.

# Development Roadmap
## Phase 1: Core Sui Infrastructure
1. Research and document `sui` (protocol core, Move framework).
2. Research and document `bcs` (binary canonical serialization).
3. Research and document `fastcrypto` and `narwhal`.
4. Create verification scripts for core primitives.

## Phase 2: Major DeFi Protocols
1. Research and document `scallop-sdk` and `scallop-io`.
2. Research and document `navi-sdk` and `naviprotocol`.
3. Research and document `cetus-clmm-sui-sdk` and `CetusProtocol`.
4. Research and document `sea-protocol`.
5. Research and document `legato-finance`.
6. Create verification scripts for lending, swapping, and prediction markets.

## Phase 3: Tools and Specialized SDKs
1. Research and document `deepbookpy`.
2. Research and document `sui-butler`.
3. Research and document `sui-defi-vault`.
4. Research and document `core-ts`.
5. Create verification scripts for vault management, CLI tools, and cross-protocol swappers.

## Phase 4: Community and Utility Projects
1. Research and document `Memetic-LaunchPad`.
2. Research and document `cetus-volume-booster-bot-sui`.
3. Research and document `gemwalletcom`.
4. Finalize `sui-docs` structure and cross-references.

# Logical Dependency Chain
1. Core infrastructure documentation must come first to establish basic concepts.
2. Major DeFi protocols follow as they build upon core primitives.
3. Specialized tools and community projects are documented last.

# Risks and Mitigations
- **Repository Stale**: Some repositories might be outdated. Mitigation: Check last commit dates and verify with CLI/curl.
- **Complexity**: High number of repositories. Mitigation: Structured approach using Phase-based roadmap.
