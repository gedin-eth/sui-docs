Welcome to the **Sui Builder's Manual** - a version-pinned, runnable, and tested reference implementation for building on the Sui network.

This manual serves as a "Golden State" for developers and AI agents to ensure that implementation details (RPCs, package versions, transaction patterns) are accurate and tested against the live network.

## Core Philosophy

1. **Pin Everything**: No more guessing which SDK version works with which CLI
2. **Everything is Executable**: Every chapter includes a verified code example
3. **Troubleshooting as First-Class Content**: Common errors are indexed with exact remediation steps
4. **AI-Friendly**: Structured configurations allow generative AI to work within strict guardrails

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run doctor
```
